# Prudens-Project
Prudens is a platform that offers a scientific social media that is sufficiently advanced to satisfy modern demands, allowing a man of science to concentrate on scientific content without being sidetracked by attempts to validate it. The principle of this platform is that users should only discuss topics they are knowledgeable about and provide evidence to back up their claims. By doing this, it hopes to provide a reliable setting where readers may have faith in the authors and their work.

Our vision is trust, where every post is reliable, and where microphones arenâ€™t in the hands of anyone with something to say, but in the hands of trusted individuals with something truthful to say.
